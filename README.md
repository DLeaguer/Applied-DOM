# Applied DOM

Additional Apply Bind Call Exercises

## Exercise Preparation

1. fork and clone this repo
2. run command `npm install` to get dependencies
3. open the project in your code editor
4. follow the instructions detailed in each comment block found in file: `./js/app.js`
5. run the command `npm start` to start your server
6. open your browser to `http://localhost:8080` if it does not open automatically

## Understanding the app

1. Help finish the app to make it work.
2. your code after each comment block will help the previous code(s) to function. 
3. a single code after each comment block will not work by itself.
4. this step by step exercise will work when the buttons are coded to make a click event. No click event, No work. 
5. If you want to see if there is an error in a section of code , you can use console.log, then look in your browsers Developer Tools Console for errors. 

## Your Goal

1. your goal is to write click event handlers for each blue button, that when triggered, will turn it's "light" color from red to green
2. commit after each button successfully turns it's light color to green

## Hints

1. The red lights will not turn green until you start adding event listeners. 
2. The first event listener occurrance is after the 4th comment block.  
3. Do at least the first 4 instruction blocks before testing any buttons.
4. To see if there are errors before the 4th instruction block, you can use console.log and check the browsers Developer Tools Console.

You will know a button should do something when you add an event handler to it.
